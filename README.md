# Workshop: Audio Reactive Visuals w/Touch Designer, Ableton & Orca
_This workshop explores the creation of generative and parametric visuals, using TouchDesigner, and integrating sounds with Ableton Live and Orca. The goal of this workshop is to provide you with a introductory overview of Touch Designer, an understanding of how to use midi to power the animation of dynamic visuals being output by Touch Designer. You will leave with a simple set-up that can be used as a base/starting point (feel free to iterate and build out your own bespoke setup!) in the context of an artistic installation or an audiovisual performance._  <br />
